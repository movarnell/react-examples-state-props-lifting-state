import React from 'react'

// Define a functional component named `Child` that takes in `props` as a parameter
export default function Child(props) {
  // Render a div element that displays information passed via `props`

// This code defines a React functional component named Child, which takes in props as a parameter. The props object is then used to display some information inside a div element. Specifically, the component expects the props object to have three properties: name, taste, and value.

// The rendered text will say that the {props.props.name} (presumably some type of food) is the most {props.props.taste} thing you can buy for ${props.props.value}. The use of props.props is a bit unusual, but presumably the parent component is passing down an object with another props property, which contains the actual properties being used here.
